##SONAR

Sonar is a small location based chatroom created in HackNY 2011 fall.

The concept of this application is let user be able to talk to the people around you.

In the limited time, we use the foursquare api to find the hotspot around. And create chatroom on the hotspot.

Using node.js, socket.io and mongoose(mongodb orm)
